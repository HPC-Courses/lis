README for Microsoft Build Engine
=================================

Run the following command to generate Makefile 
(See configure.bat --help for details): 

> configure.bat
 
To build the library, run the following command:

> nmake 

If win32.mak is not available in your computing environment, 
download Windows SDK 7.1 from Microsoft's home page and install it.
Then set path to the directory where win32.mak locates
(C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Include,
for example) by adding it to your environment variables.

To ensure that the library has been built successfully, enter

> nmake check

The following command copies the library files to lis-($VERSION)\lib 
and the executable files to lis-($VERSION)\bin, respectively:

> nmake install
